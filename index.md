Hello, and Welcome to my homepage. I am a senior undergraduate, pursuing by Bachelors and Masters (dual-degree) at the Indian Institue of Techonlogy Bombay ([IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in)). I'm an [Electrical Engineering major](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/), with a specialisation in Nanoelectronics. This year, I am working on my Master's thesis, and I will graduate in the following summer. 

I am passionate about quantum technology, and am excited by the promising prospects it holds for tomorrow :)  I have developed a keen interest in quantum information and condensed matter physics. You can find my work in these areas on the [Research](http://praveen5.github.io/research/) tab. My academic life has been delineated on the [Resum√©](http://praveen5.github.io/resume/) page. 

I am an ardent follower of the sporting world, with a proclivity for cricket and football. I also enjoy playing classical pieces on the synthesiser. 

The attenuating borders of the once believed to be antithetical realms of the scientific and spiritual world has a telling effect in the way we think about science! In this regard, I actively participate in [Ekatva Gita](http://songofoneness.com/objective-and-structure/) workshops, organised by [Sri Balagopal Ramachandran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balagopal-ramachandran-5a42262/), a venerate teacher at the [Oneness University](http://onenessuniversity.org/).
