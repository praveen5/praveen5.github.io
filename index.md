Hello, and welcome to my homepage. I'm a PhD student in [Applied Physics](http://appliedphysics.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](http://stanford.edu). I work on quantum simulation of many-body systems on a quantum dot platform in David Goldhaber-Gordon's [group](http://ggg.stanford.edu) at the Geballe Laboratory of Advanced Materials ([GLAM](http://glam.stanford.edu)). Check out more about my work [here](http://praveen5.github.io/research/). In 2019, I graduated with a Bachelors and Masters in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/), specializing in Nanoelectronics, from the Indian Institue of Techonlogy Bombay ([IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in)). I worked on my Master's thesis in Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan's [Quantum Transport group](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/bmwebpage).  

I am passionate about quantum technology and excited by the prospects it holds for tomorrow :)  I have developed a keen interest in quantum information and condensed matter physics. You can find my work in these areas on the [Research](http://praveen5.github.io/research/) tab. My academic life has been delineated on my [CV](http://praveen5.github.io/resume/) page. 

I enjoy sports, and particularly follow cricket and football (soccer). I also enjoy playing the piano and I'm part of the Stanford New Ensemble. I've been learning the culinary secrets of haute cuisine and enjoy experiments in the kitchen ;) 

[//]: <The blurring borders of the scientific and spiritual world has caught my interest. I actively participate in [Ekatva Gita](https://twitter.com/ekatvagita) workshops, organized by [Sri Balagopal Ramachandran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balagopal-ramachandran-5a42262/), a venerable teacher at the [Oneness University](http://www.sri-ammabhagavan.org).>
