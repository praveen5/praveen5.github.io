Hello, and welcome to my homepage. I'm a PhD student in Applied Physics at Stanford University. Next month I start as a Graduate Research Assistant in Prof. David Goldhaber-Gordon's group at the Geballe Laboratory of Advanced Materials. In 2019, I graduated with a Bachelors and Masters in [Electrical Engineering major](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/), specialising in Nanoelectronics, from the Indian Institue of Techonlogy Bombay ([IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in)). I worked on my Master's thesis in Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan's [Quantum Transport group](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/bmwebpage).  

I am passionate about quantum technology, and excited by the promising prospects it holds for tomorrow :)  I have developed a keen interest in quantum information and condensed matter physics. You can find my work in these areas on the [Research](http://praveen5.github.io/research/) tab. My academic life has been delineated on my [CV](http://praveen5.github.io/resume/) page. 

I am an ardent follower of the sporting world, with a proclivity for cricket and football (soccer). I also enjoy playing classical pieces on the synthesiser. 

The attenuating borders of the once believed to be antithetical realms of the scientific and spiritual world has a telling effect in the way we think about the world around us. In this regard, I actively participate in [Ekatva Gita](http://songofoneness.com/objective-and-structure/) workshops, organised by [Sri Balagopal Ramachandran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balagopal-ramachandran-5a42262/), a venerable teacher at the [Oneness University](http://onenessuniversity.org/).
