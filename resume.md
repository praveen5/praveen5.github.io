## Summer Schools and Workshops
I have participated in the following workshops 

<img src="/ekEs3pE5.jpg" alt="QTurn" align="left" width="128" title="QTurn">
**Q-Turn : changing paradigms in quantum science**, at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brazil. This workshop brought together leading researchers in quantum information, foundations and resource theory for a week full of insightful talks and discussions in the picturesque city of Florianópolis. Apart from a scientific program, there were also talks and discussions on issues that affect the quantum information community, ranging from diversity and inclusion, health and mental health, to workers' rights.

**Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor**, a Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) Course orgained at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. This week-long course by Prof. Supriyo Datta took us through a bottom-up apporach to quantum transport and introduced us to the Non-Equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF). _(Winter 2016)_

### MOOC

<img src="/MITx.png" alt="MITx" align="left" width="128" title="MITx">
In my freshman year I took MIT's intermediate-level Quantum Physcis course on edX - [_Mastering Quantum Mechanics_](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiX46u7ocHdAhUIfSsKHTclBpYQFjABegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcourses.edx.org%2Fcourses%2FMITx%2F8.05x%2F1T2015%2Finfo&usg=AOvVaw00lP9T-h6dfw-zltFBwCAa) on [edX](http://edx.org) and earned this [certificate](https://s3.amazonaws.com/verify.edx.org/downloads/6da8ceac9e7f4d25b6bcf0d761798975/Certificate.pdf) as a verified student.
