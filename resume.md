Please find my extended CV [here](http://home.iitb.ac.in/~praveen5/cv.pdf). 

Here's a brief list of appointments --
*  **[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in)** -- Bachelors & Masters of Technology (Dual Degree) in Electrical Engineering with a specialisation in Microelectronics _(Jul 2014 - Jun 2019 (expected))_


*  Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Institute for Quantum Computing **[IQC Waterloo](http://iqc.ca)** in Prof. Jonathan Baugh's Coherent Spintronics Group _(Summer 2018)_


*  Summer Intern at the Institute for Science and Technology **[IST Austria](http://ist.at)** in Prof. Georgios Katsros's Nanoelectronics  Group _(Summer 2017)_

In my pursuit to appreciate the beauty of the quantum world, I participated in the following workshops 


*  **Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP)**, at the Institute for Quantum Computing, in the University of Waterloo, Canada. This was a 2-week school organised by the faculty at IQC, which introduced us to the theoretical & experimental aspects of Quantum Information Processing. _(Summer 2018)_

*  **Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor**, a Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) Course orgained at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. This week-long course by Prof. Supriyo Datta took us through a bottom-up apporach to quantum transport and introduced us to the Non-Equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF). _(Winter 2017)_

*  **Summer School on Modern Physics at All Scales**, at Universitiet Leiden, in The Netherlands. Organised over a period of 10-days by the emminent physics faculty of Leiden, including the likes of Carlo Beenakker and Dirk Bouwmeester, this summer school gave me a holistic exposire to the diverse fields of research in modern physics. _(Summer 2016)_

### MOOC

In my freshman year I worked on MIT's intermediate-level Quantum Physcis course - [_Mastering Quantum Mechanics_](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiX46u7ocHdAhUIfSsKHTclBpYQFjABegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcourses.edx.org%2Fcourses%2FMITx%2F8.05x%2F1T2015%2Finfo&usg=AOvVaw00lP9T-h6dfw-zltFBwCAa) on [edX](http://edx.org) and earned this [certificate](https://s3.amazonaws.com/verify.edx.org/downloads/6da8ceac9e7f4d25b6bcf0d761798975/Certificate.pdf) as a verified student.
