Semiconductor nanowires with superconducting contacts have been an area of significant interest for over a couple of decades. They provide a promising platform for hosting unpaired Majorana fermions and a prospect for realizing a fault-tolerant topological quantum computer. In this work, we employ the Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (NEGF) Formalism to model quantum transport in normal (N)-superconductor(S) junctions. In particular, we extensively study the N-S junction under a potential bias, reproducing  Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) ’s results. We go beyond the Andreev approximation limit and delineate the interesting features observed in the conductance and current spectral density outside this approximation. We then analyze Josephson junctions based on semiconductor nanowires and calculate the Andreev bound state spectrum and current-phase relations using NEGF. Recently, [1], and [2] have reported oscillations in the critical supercurrent with an axial magnetic field. This phenomenon arises from the interference of orbital angular momentum modes of the nanowire. We study the effect of disorder on critical current oscillations with an aim to gain a thoroughgoing understanding of the experiments.

### 2. A Bayesian View of Quantum Clocks
_Under the guidance of Prof. Manoj Gopalkrishnan and Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan at IIT Bombay_

We bring a Bayesian approach to the analysis of clocks. Using exponential distributions as priors for clocks, we analyze how well one can keep time with a single qubit freely precessing under a magnetic field. We find that, at least with a single qubit, quantum mechanics does not allow exact timekeeping, in contrast to classical mechanics, which does. We find the design of the single-qubit clock that leads to maximum accuracy. Further, we find an energy versus accuracy tradeoff—the energy cost is at least kT times the improvement in accuracy as measured by the entropy reduction in going from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution. We propose a physical realization of the single-qubit clock using charge transport across a capacitively coupled quantum dot.

### 3. Spin Qubits in Germanium Hutwires, and Superconducting Coplanar Waveguide Resonators for Control
_Under the guidance of Prof. Georgios Katsaros at IST Austra_

My work involved the SEM imaging and design of contacts on Germanium nanowires grown on monocrystalline Silicon substrates. I worked with low-temperature experiments in characterising the conductance and transfer response of these nanowires in a 4 K Helium setup. I designed Niobium resonators, and performed extensive simulations on Sonnet to extract loaded quality factor and coupling rate and attempted measurement of Nb resonator at 4 K.
